**Chess Pro: DSA Semester Final Project**

This Chess application serves as a comprehensive exploration of Data Structures and Algorithms through game development. The core architecture utilizes an 8x8 2D Array for the game board, ensuring $O(1)$ time complexity for piece lookups and state updates. The move-validation engine implements specific traversal algorithms for sliding pieces (Rooks, Bishops, Queens) and leaping pieces (Knights), while the Undo functionality is managed via a Stack data structure that captures and restores deep-cloned board states.

A critical algorithmic component of the project is the King Safety/Check Detection logic. Every move is pre-simulated on a temporary board state to verify that the player does not remain in or move into a state of "Check." This involves scanning the board for enemy attack vectors, demonstrating an efficient implementation of search and collision detection. The project also features a modern UI with custom local image assets, automatic pawn promotion, and a responsive design, bridging the gap between back-end algorithmic rigor and front-end usability.
